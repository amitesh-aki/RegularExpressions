This collides with Python’s usage of the same character for the same purpose in string literals; for example, to match a literal backslash, one might have to write `'\\\\\\\\'` as the pattern string, because the regular expression must be `\\\\`, and each backslash must be expressed as `\\\\` inside a regular Python string literal.\n",

    "The solution is to use Python’s raw string notation for regular expression patterns; backslashes are not handled in any special way in a string literal prefixed with `'r'`. So `r\"\\n\"` is a two-character string containing `'\\'` and `'n'`, while `\"\\n\"` is a one-character string containing a newline. Usually patterns will be expressed in Python code using this raw string notation."
